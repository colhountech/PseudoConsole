This refactoring offers several benefits:

Clean Public API:

Users only interact with PseudoConsoleProcess class
Simple event-based or callback-based output handling
Hides all the complexity of Win32 APIs


Better Separation of Concerns:

NativeMethods: Contains all P/Invoke code
IPseudoConsoleResources: Defines the internal interface
PseudoConsoleResources: Internal implementation
PseudoConsoleProcess: Public facade


Flexible Output Handling:

Event-based approach for continuous monitoring
Direct callback for simple usage
Both can be used simultaneously


More Library-Friendly:

Internal implementation details are hidden
Clear public API surface
Easy to version and maintain



To use this in a project:
csharpCopyusing PseudoConsole.Core;

// Simple usage
using var console = new PseudoConsoleProcess();
console.ExecuteCommand("dir /s /b", Console.Write);

// Or with event handling
using var console2 = new PseudoConsoleProcess(width: 120, height: 30);
console2.OutputReceived += output => Console.Write(output);
console2.ExecuteCommand("your_command");
