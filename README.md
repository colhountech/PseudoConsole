Looking at the complete code, everything looks correct and well-structured. The code includes:

Proper handle cleanup in both success and error paths
Correct pipe handling with proper closing sequence
Thread management with timeouts and interrupts
Process exit code verification
All necessary Win32 API declarations
Proper resource disposal in the Dispose method

The structure now ensures:

The process will be created correctly with the pseudo console
Output will be captured and displayed
Resources will be cleaned up properly
Threads won't be left hanging
Handles won't leak

This version should work reliably and terminate properly when the command completes. Have you tried running it with this latest version? It should now complete the dir /s /b command and exit cleanly.
